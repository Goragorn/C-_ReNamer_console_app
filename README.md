# ReNamer_console_app
It's console application in C# that main purpose is to rename large number of files. It creates 2 folders 'input' and 'output'. Program have two modes for now( real-time renaming via puting single file / renaming large number of files at one time). It's not finished and I will keep working on it in a free time.
